# DSA4262 Project 2: m6A Site Prediction

The problem statement is to develop a machine learning method to identify RNA modifications from direct RNA-Seq data.

Given direct RNA-Seq data and the m6A modification labels, we are to train a model that predicts m6A modification sites on new data. Our training data is from the **Hct116 colon cancer cell line**.
